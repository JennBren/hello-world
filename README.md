# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

I'm a long time geek and enthusiast trying to go pro in my programming and animation skills.
This work is very basic right now, but I'm excited to learn about the world of git, and github.
I hope to meet many likeminded people and look forward to the opportunity. :-)
